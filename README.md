  <h1 align="center">Pareto Optimal TVs Problem</h1>
</p>

## Problem Statement
Billy wishes to buy a television. He has characterised all the TVs on the 
market by giving each of them k feature scores between 0 and 10 (with 10 being a ‘better’ score 
than 0). TV A is said to ‘dominate’ TV B if it is as good or better than TV B across all scores. The 
‘pareto optimal’ subset of TVs are those TVs within the TVs on the market that are not 
dominated by any TV. 
1. Write a function to generate N random TVs. 
2. Write a function to check whether one TV dominates another. 
3. Write a function to find the pareto-optimal subset of TVs from a provided list. 
Bonus: What if comparing TV scores was computationally expensive?
